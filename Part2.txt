QUERIES FOR PART 2:

  This project was a little tricky for me. I was unsure if I was misunderstanding something or if its correct. 
  I read over the steps of the assignment like 10 times and it seems I have everything required.
  

// Insert the sample book data:

db.books.insertMany([
  {
    title: "The Hobbit",
    author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    genre: "Fantasy",
    publishedYear: 1937,
  },
  {
    title: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    author: "Harper Lee",
    genre: "Fiction",
    publishedYear: 1960,
  },
  {
    title: "1984",
    author: "George Orwell",
    genre: "Dystopian",
    publishedYear: 1949,
  },
]);

// Retrive the titles of the books

    db.books.find({}, { title: 1, _id: 0 });

// Find all books written by Tolkein

    db.books.find({ author: "J.R.R. Tolkien" });

// Update genre of "1984" to Science Fiction

    db.books.updateOne({ title: "1984" }, { $set: { genre: "Science Fiction" } });

// Delete The Hobbitt

    db.books.deleteOne({ title: "The Hobbit" });
